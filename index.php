						"Come, Dorothy!" cried the Wizard.  "Hurry up, or the balloon will fly away." "I can't find Toto anywhere," replied Dorothy, who did not wish to leave her little dog behind.  Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten, and Dorothy at last found him.  She picked him up and ran towards the balloon. She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the air without her. "Come back!" she screamed.  "I want to go, too!" "I can't come back, my dear," called Oz from the basket.  "Good-bye!"

A woman screamed. Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible to us.  Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless in the warm sunlight. "The sojers'll stop 'em," said a woman beside me, doubtfully.  A haziness rose over the treetops. Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.
